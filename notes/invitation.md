hello!

a game's afoot!
for those of you already familiar with sql, (maybe because you've attended my workshop, from zero to query), but who would like some practice with querying databases, i have a (fun) murder mystery for you to solve.

it will take a bit of sleuthing, questioning, and lateral thinking (sql) to find the culprit from a database of case files, fresh from the server room at police hq. so, can *you* SELECT the criminal needle in the haystack of innocent suspects?
let me know with a response here if you are interested in practicing your detective skills, then i will send you an invite to a 30 minute call at the end of day next wednesday (2023-09-20).

looking forward to seeing you cracking the case!

before the session, participating detectives will need to:
download a (small) database file from police hq (contact me for a copy)
have `sqlite3` installed on their machine (comes preinstalled on macs)
know how to form simple sql queries with `SELECT ... FROM ... JOIN ... WHERE ...`  (all of which are covered in *from zero to query*)

before the session, participating detectives will need to:

- know how to form simple sql queries with `SELECT... FROM... JOIN... WHERE... `
- have `sqlite3` installed on their machine (comes preinstalled on all macs).
- download a (small) database file from police headquarters.
