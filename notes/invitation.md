hello!

for those of you who are already familiar with sql, (maybe because you attended my workshop from zero to query), but who would like a bit of practice with querying databases, i have a fun little murder mystery for you to solve.

it only takes is a bit of sleuthing, questioning, and lateral thinking to find the answers from a database of case files. so, can you find the dangerous needle in the haystack of innocent suspects?

let me know here if you are interested in practicing your detective skills and i will add you to a 30 minute call at the end of day on wednesday the 30th of august.

before the session, participating detectives will need to:

- know how to form simple sql queries with `SELECT... FROM... JOIN... WHERE... `
- have sqlite3 installed on their machine (comes preinstalled on all macs).
- download a (small) database file from police headquarters.
